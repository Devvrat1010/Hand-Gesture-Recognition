# Hand-Gesture-Recognition
Hi ðŸ‘‹guys , welcome to our repository for the next one year (Hopefully) ðŸ˜… !! 

This repository is made to create a Hand Gesture Recognition algorithm .

Please start learning the following pre requisites for making the algorithm .

# What to learn 

### 1.Git

### 2.Python

### 3.Numpy

### 4.OpenCv

### 5.Tensorflow


# Where to learn ? 		

### 1.Git 

  @NotTheRightGuy has created a wonderful repository for learning git.
  - https://github.com/NotTheRightGuy/Learning-Git
  
#### When You are done with learning git , you are requested to fork this repository and update the members.txt file and add your details in the similar manner as I have done it .

#### After making suitable changes, create a push request and your changes will be reflected in the remote repository after approval.

#### After that you will be provided with the repository you will be working for the next year.
#### 2.Python 

  There are various sources to learn python.Most basic of them all is the following book .
  
  - [Automate the boring stuffs with python (2).pdf](https://github.com/devvrat324/Hand-Gesture-Recognition/files/9740959/Automate.the.boring.stuffs.with.python.2.pdf)
  
  Or if you want a more interactive approach , following websites are good source for learning .
  
  - https://www.w3schools.com/python/
  
  - https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python3/

### 3.Numpy
  - https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/default.asp

### 4.OpenCv
 - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/opencv-python-tutorial/

### 5.Tensorflow
 - https://www.tutorialspoint.com/tensorflow/
 
# Final Note 
 - #### Do not see this project as just a way to get marks and get done with it but rather as a stepping stones to improve your skils and get a feel on how open source project works.

 - #### Do not spend all your time learning stuffs and watching tutorials. Project based learning is the best way to learn something new in this field. If you learn something new, try to implement it somewhere and try to changes something and see the result.

 - #### The workflow for this project and a Scrum board will be shared on this repo and calender will be created once we are done with learning stuffs

 - #### Regarding any queries You can contact me at any time and I hope you give your best and time to this project.

 - #### In the end , Spark your imagination and just go crazy

 - #### Feel free to change this README.md and switch things up in your local repo

 - #### If you find anything wrong or grammar mistake, please correct it and create a push request
 
### Peace Out âœŒ
