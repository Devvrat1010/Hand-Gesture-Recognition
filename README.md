# Hand-Gesture-Recognition
Hi üëãguys , welcome to our repository for the next one year (Hopefully) üòÖ !! 

This repository is made to create a Hand Gesture Recognition algorithm .

The workflow will be created in the coming week or so.

Till then please start learning the following pre requisites for making the algorithm .

1.Git

2.Python

3.Numpy

4.OpenCv


5.Tensorflow

Where to learn ?
1.Git 
  @NotTheRightGuy has created a wonderful repository for learning git.

2.Python 
  There are various sources to learn python.Most basic of them all is the following book .
  
  [Automate the boring stuffs with python (2).pdf](https://github.com/devvrat324/Hand-Gesture-Recognition/files/9740959/Automate.the.boring.stuffs.with.python.2.pdf)
  
  Or if you want a more interactive approach , following websites are good source for learning .
  
  https://www.w3schools.com/python/
  
  https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python3/

3.Numpy
